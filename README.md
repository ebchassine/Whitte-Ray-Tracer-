### Whitted Ray Tracer 

This project simulates a simple ray tracer in VLang, a low level language with garbage collection, optimized for graphics processing,
and also optimized syntax for some ease of use. 

The project itself renders scenes from .json files and runs it through a pipeline in P02_Raytrace
